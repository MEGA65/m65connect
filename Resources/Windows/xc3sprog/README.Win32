Building with mingw32
=====================

To (cross)build with recent mingw, following packages need to be installed:
- mingw32-(cross-)gcc and it's dependancies
- mingw32-(cross-)gcc-c++
- mingw32-(cross-)pkg-config
- mingw32-libftdi1 mingw32-libftdi1-devel

Tested as cross-compile on OpenSuse LEAP 42.2/42.3.

Parallelport Access via the $VDMLPT device and the PARVDM service
================================================================

The get the desired access, check that
- the BIOS is set to EPP(ECP/EPP) mode for the LPT device
- the parvdm service is running "sc query parvdm"

On different machines here, "sc start parvdm" refused to start the service
with  Error 1058. You can get information about the parvdm in the Device
Manager with the display of hidden devices enables under the NON-PNP
section.


Sometimes deinstalling parvdm in the device manager and then reenabling it
with regedit by setting "Start" to "2" in
HKLM/SYSTEM/ControlSet001/Services/ParVdm
got it working.

Please report your findings!

Lib-USB Access
==============
For devices access to devices with already installed drivers, like the
Xilinx Download cables or FTDI cables with default VID:PID, install the
filter driver. Follow the instructions given in the download page of the
sourceforge libusb-win32 project.

Only if your device has no driver, create an inf file as explaind in
the "Device driver Installation" on above page.
